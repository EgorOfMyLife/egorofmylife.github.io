      Before reading the article, I had read this question and immediately I came up with my own metaphor. I see websites as boxes that are filled with Lego bricks that are waiting to be put into order. When I was a little boy, I used to play with Legos a lot. I would build a box and then arrange the insides as a room with all kinds of commodities and entertainment that would serve a little Lego man. In my metaphor, the lego man is the user and the room is the website. As you can see, this view is very much like the first metaphor that Lauren Schwulst presents. Indeed, that first description of hers resonated with me stronger than the others, even though it was still interesting to see the following approaches as well. I generally agree with the sentiments that were suggested in this reading and the previous ones; technological autonomy just like any other freedom should be a right, it should be promoted as such and people need to educate themselves in order to be able to independently judge how well their freedoms are preserved.
